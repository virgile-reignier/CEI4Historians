CEI4Historians
===

As part of [our PhD](https://www.theses.fr/s349095), we developed a framework for analysing medieval acts in series.

## CEI2TEI

Our project is based on the work of the [Charters Encoding Initiative](http://www.cei.lmu.de/) and its adaptation to TEIP5: https://github.com/GVogeler/CEI2TEI

## Objectives

- annotate the people, places and assets mentioned in the documents studied
- associate people, places and units of measurement with an index to disambiguate them
- produce quantitative analyses that take into account the place of these elements in diplomatic discourse

## Repository content

- the compiled cei_tei schema is used as the source for chaining our ODD
- the cei_for_historians schema is available in the form of an ODD and an rng schema
- we used xQuery queries to check the integrity of certain elements
- we add a few examples of files encoded using this scheme
